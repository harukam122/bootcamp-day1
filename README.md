<h2>ðŸ§¸ Mini-Blueno</h2>

<pre>
ðŸ’¡ This is my implementation of Dear Blueno, a form submission forum.
</pre>


<body>
  To implement this, I used React.js, MongoDB, Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
  You can click on "Submit Post" and input any title and body text, and submit. Your post will show up as a Post Modal on the page, where you can also comment on other posts!
